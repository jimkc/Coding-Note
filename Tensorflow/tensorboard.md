**Use tensorbord with pytorch**
Install <b>tensorboardx</b> at https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX.<br>

**Use tensor board to monitor from remote ip server**
Opening default setting of tensorboard in current browser will only monitor local training process, 
so wee need to change settings while logging to remote server.<br>
